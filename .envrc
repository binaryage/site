# Environment management via mise
# mise is a modern polyglot version manager (Ruby, Node.js, etc.) with excellent IDE integration
# Install: brew install mise
# Versions are specified in .tool-versions file

# mise has built-in auto-switching, but we keep this for compatibility with tools that use direnv
# Note: Don't use 'use mise' - it's experimental. mise activates automatically via shell integration.

# Add any project-specific environment variables below
# Example:
# export RAILS_ENV=development
# export DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost/myapp_dev
